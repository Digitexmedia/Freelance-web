# Tipmaxstiven Investments - Simple Auth Demo

## How It Works

- **Registration** saves username/password to localStorage.
- **Login** checks username/password from localStorage.
- Upon login, `loggedInUser` key is set.
- **Dashboard** checks if `loggedInUser` exists; else redirects to login.
- User can log out from dashboard.

## To run

Open `index.html` in your browser and navigate via "Get Started" buttons.
